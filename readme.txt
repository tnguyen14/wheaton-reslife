Provide Custom Post Type support and other functionalities for Wheaton College Residential Life page

== Description ==

## Dependencies
This plugin requires [Super CPT](http://wordpress.org/plugins/super-cpt/) and [Posts 2 Posts](http://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/) plugins.

## Custom Post Types
* Staff
* Building

## Fields
### Staff
* Description (default content editor)
* Email
* Title
* Major
* Classyear

### Building
* Description (default content editor)

## Taxonomies
### Quad
For both staff and buildings

### Attributes
For buildings

## Future
Super CPT currently does not support repeatable field, which makes it difficult to have building images and floor plans as separate custom fields.
For now, they can be added as galleries in the main editor.

@TODO: look for ways to implement repeater field.
