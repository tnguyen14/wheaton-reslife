Provide Custom Post Type support and other functionalities for Wheaton College Residential Life page

== Description ==

## Custom Post Types

* Staff
* Building

## Dependencies
This plugin requires [Super CPT](http://wordpress.org/plugins/super-cpt/) and [Posts 2 Posts](http://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/) plugins.

## Fields
Staff has the following fields:
* Description (default content editor)
* Email
* Title

Building has the following fields:
* Description (default content editor)

## Future
Super CPT currently does not support repeatable field, which makes it difficult to have building images and floor plans as separate custom fields.
For now, they can be added as galleries in the main editor.

@TODO: look for ways to implement repeater field.
